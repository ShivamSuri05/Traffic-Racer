# Traffic-Racer
We as a team of 2 developed a car game using OpenGl library.<br>
We used Visual Studio 2019 IDE to develop this.<br>
## Getting Started
1. You need to start a new console application project in the IDE.<br>
2. Now in the .cpp file just paste the code given in main.cpp and run it.<br>
To understand its working kindly refer the pdf document.
### Thanks
### Happy Coding :)
